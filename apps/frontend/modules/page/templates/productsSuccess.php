          <p>
            To get started you need to create a list of proposed features.
            If you work in an agile environment you may call them user stories and the feature list is a backlog.
            If you have them in an excel sheet or another system, simply import them into Sensor Six.

            Now you have all the input and only need to find out what is best to develop.
            Adjust the Weights of criteria, create scenarios, spot features that don't
            provide much value, intelligently allocate your available funds, manually force in or out features
            and create the perfect road map or sprint plan.
